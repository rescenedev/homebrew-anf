  caveats <<~EOS
    anf is a self-signed build (not notarized). The cask strips the quarantine
    flag automatically, but if macOS still blocks it on first launch:
      • Right-click anf.app → Open, then confirm, or
      • Run: xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/anf.app

    Optional tools for richer search:
      brew install fd ripgrep
